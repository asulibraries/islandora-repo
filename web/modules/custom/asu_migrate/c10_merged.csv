Recent fiscal conditions in higher education make learning landscape development more challenging due to finite resources and competing priorities. Similarly, academic libraries are experiencing substantial budget and staff reductions. Despite these trends, academic libraries are in a strong position to contribute to surrounding learning landscapes by expanding student online learning opportunities and promoting the critical use of information. Evolving learning technologies available for free or at low cost provide higher education and libraries with the tools to respond to this fluid environment.",,,,,,,,Preprint,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0,Public,,2015-03-27 21:11:07.415164+00:00,2018-06-29 22:08:01.305277+00:00,1,,,28443.0,,"Kammerlocher, Lisa","Couture, Julianne","Sparks, Olivia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Information Literacy in Learning Landscapes: Flexible, Adaptable, Low-cost Solutions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Information literacy|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh00007046,Web based instruction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Staff scholarship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Digital Document,,Information literacy|http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh00007046||Web based instruction,,"Kammerlocher, Lisa||Couture, Julianne||Sparks, Olivia"
